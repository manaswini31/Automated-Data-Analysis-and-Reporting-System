# Automated-Data-Analysis-and-Reporting-System

The project is designed to streamline the data analysis process by automatically generating detailed reports in various formats such as HTML, PDF, and Word. These reports provide a comprehensive analysis of the dataset, highlighting key aspects such as missing values, data types, duplicate columns, and constant columns.

Once the analysis is complete, the outputs are automatically downloaded and opened in the specified formats, ensuring that users can immediately review the results without any additional steps. This automatic handling of outputs and report generation significantly enhances the efficiency of the analysis process.

Moreover, the visualizations, which are included in the reports, are saved in user-defined folders, ensuring that they are organized and easily accessible. This seamless workflow not only saves time but also makes the process of analyzing and interpreting data more efficient and user-friendly.
